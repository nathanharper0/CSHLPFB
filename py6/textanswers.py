1a. the difference is that defining set() will consider each character alone, therefore in this case it
becomes {'A','T','G'} but if you define as {'ATGAG'}, it considers that as one value in the list so it makes
a list with one entry containing the entire 'ATGAG'
1b. so yes it does matter
1c. 3 for mySet, 1 for mySet2
